# City-HEAT

Forked from original repository at https://github.com/SrayUM/City-HEAT.
Branch `savio` includes modifications to run on Savio, Berkeley's HPC. 

Original README:

City-Heat Equity Adaptation Tool (C++, R, Bash)

This repository contains all of the code used for the study described in the following working paper:


Shi, R., Hobbs, B., Quinn, D., Knopman, D., Lempert, R. (2021). City-Heat Equity Adaptation Tool (City-HEAT): A Comprehensive Decision Support Tool Considering Multiple Objectives, Uncertainty, and Adaptive Management for Urban Heat Adaptation

This research project was conducted using computational resources (and/or scientific computing services) at the Maryland Advanced Research Computing Center ([MARCC](https://www.marcc.jhu.edu/)). The MARCC high-performance computing (HPC) environment utilizes the [SLURM](https://www.marcc.jhu.edu/getting-started/running-jobs/) queuing system for its parallel programming tasks. This code has _not_ been tested nor run on a personal machine.

Contents:

`Data`: Directory containing all of the data input needed in this paper, including district-level demographic and temperature deviation data, temperature projections from 2020 to 2039, temperature observations at BWI airport, and parameter values in each scenario for optimization and re-evaluation, respectively.

`Compile`: Directory containing code for Optimization. 

`Optimization`: Directory containing the code for optimizing the City-HEAT using DPS and Borg-MOEA

`Re-evaluation`: Directory containing the code for re-evaluating the policies found from the above optimization on a set of alternative SOWs and calculating the satisficing metric for each policy

To reproduce the results from this study, follow the steps given in the `README` of the `Data`, `Compile`, `Optimization`, and `Re-evaluation` directory.
